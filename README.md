# SSH Dynamic Proxy Optimization

This repository contains configurations, commands, and techniques to optimize the performance of an SSH dynamic proxy (SOCKS proxy) for maximum speed and efficiency. These optimizations focus on enhancing connection speed, reducing latency, and improving throughput by tweaking SSH client and server settings.

## Overview

Using SSH's dynamic port forwarding, we can set up a SOCKS proxy to route traffic through a secure SSH tunnel. However, the default configuration may not always offer optimal performance, especially when dealing with high-latency or high-bandwidth networks. This repository provides detailed configurations to enhance the efficiency of SSH dynamic proxy connections.

## Features

- **Faster Encryption Algorithms**: Utilize faster encryption ciphers to minimize overhead while maintaining security.
- **TCP Buffer Optimization**: Tuning TCP send and receive buffers for better throughput on high-latency networks.
- **Connection Multiplexing**: Sharing multiple SSH sessions over a single connection to reduce setup time.
- **Keep-alive and Recovery Settings**: Optimizing `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` to maintain stable connections.
- **DNS Lookup Optimization**: Reducing latency by disabling DNS lookups in SSH.
- **Compression Tuning**: Balancing bandwidth savings with CPU overhead using SSH compression settings.
- **Parallel Connections**: Leveraging SSH control sockets to parallelize connections for better performance.

## Requirements

- **OpenSSH Client**: Version 6.7 or higher (for multiplexing and advanced cipher support).
- **Server**: Running SSH daemon with access to configuration changes for maximum optimization.

## Installation

To use the optimized SSH configurations, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the **Usage** section.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssh-dynamic-proxy-optimization.git
cd ssh-dynamic-proxy-optimization
```

## Usage

### Basic Optimized Command

The following command sets up an optimized SOCKS proxy on port 1080 using faster encryption, connection multiplexing, and improved TCP buffer sizes:

```bash
ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -c aes128-ctr -o ServerAliveInterval=15 -o ServerAliveCountMax=2 -o TCPRcvBuf=4194304 -o TCPSndBuf=4194304 -o UseDNS=no user@server
```

#### Explanation:
- **`-D 1080`**: Create a SOCKS proxy on local port 1080.
- **`-C`**: Enable compression to reduce bandwidth usage.
- **`-N`**: No remote commands; just set up the tunnel.
- **`-f`**: Send SSH to the background.
- **`-M`**: Enable connection multiplexing.
- **`-S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket`**: Specify the control socket for multiplexing.
- **`-c aes128-ctr`**: Use the AES-128 cipher in CTR mode for faster encryption.
- **`-o TCPRcvBuf=4194304 -o TCPSndBuf=4194304`**: Increase TCP buffer sizes for better throughput.
- **`-o UseDNS=no`**: Disable DNS lookups to reduce latency.
- **`-o ServerAliveInterval=15 -o ServerAliveCountMax=2`**: Keep the connection alive with faster recovery on failure.

### Optional Optimizations

1. **Testing with Compression**: Compare performance with and without `-C` (compression), depending on network conditions.
2. **Enabling HPN-SSH (High Performance Networking Patch)**: If both client and server support HPN-SSH, it can further improve throughput.

## Advanced Configuration

### SSH Configuration File (`~/.ssh/config`)

You can store these optimizations in your SSH config file for easier reuse:

```bash
Host my-optimized-proxy
    HostName server
    User user
    DynamicForward 1080
    Compression yes
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket
    ControlPersist yes
    Ciphers aes128-ctr
    ServerAliveInterval 15
    ServerAliveCountMax 2
    TCPRcvBuf 4194304
    TCPSndBuf 4194304
    UseDNS no
```

Now you can connect simply by typing:

```bash
ssh my-optimized-proxy
```

## Troubleshooting

- **High CPU Usage**: If CPU usage is too high with compression enabled (`-C`), try disabling it for faster results.
- **Connection Drops**: Increase `ServerAliveInterval` or decrease `ServerAliveCountMax` if your connection is unstable.
