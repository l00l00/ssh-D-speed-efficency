```bash
ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3  user@server
```
This command is setting up an SSH dynamic port forwarding session, essentially creating a SOCKS proxy on port 1080. Let's break down the individual flags and options:

1. **`-D 1080`**: This option specifies dynamic application-level port forwarding. In this case, port 1080 on the local machine will act as a SOCKS proxy, allowing you to route network traffic through the SSH server (`user@server`).

2. **`-C`**: Enables compression for the data sent over the connection. This can be useful for speeding up traffic over slower connections by reducing bandwidth usage.

3. **`-N`**: Instructs SSH not to execute any remote commands. This is useful when you are only setting up port forwarding or tunneling.

4. **`-f`**: Sends SSH to the background after the password is entered (or public key authentication is complete). This allows the session to run in the background without keeping the terminal open.

5. **`-M`**: Sets up a master SSH connection. When used in combination with the `-S` option, this allows for SSH multiplexing, where multiple SSH sessions can share a single connection.

6. **`-S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket`**: This specifies the location of the control socket used for connection multiplexing. The control socket enables other SSH sessions to reuse the same master connection without re-authenticating.

7. **`-o ServerAliveInterval=60`**: Sets the interval (in seconds) for sending "keep-alive" messages from the client to the server. This helps maintain the connection alive, especially over unreliable networks.

8. **`-o ServerAliveCountMax=3`**: This option works in conjunction with `ServerAliveInterval`. It specifies the number of keep-alive messages that can be missed before SSH considers the connection to be dead. After 3 missed keep-alives, the connection will be terminated.

9. **`user@server`**: The username and server address you are connecting to.

### Summary:
This command sets up a dynamic SOCKS proxy on your local machine (port 1080), sending all network traffic through the SSH server. Compression is enabled, and the SSH session is sent to the background. Additionally, SSH multiplexing is enabled to allow multiple SSH sessions to share the same connection.

### Example use case:
- Using this SOCKS proxy in a browser (by setting the browser to use a SOCKS5 proxy on `localhost:1080`) can route all traffic through the remote server, effectively anonymizing your browsing or bypassing network restrictions.

```
To enhance your SSH dynamic proxy for **maximum efficiency** and **speed**, you can consider making improvements in the following areas:

### 1. **Use a Faster Encryption Algorithm**
By default, SSH uses strong encryption, but for your use case (dynamic proxy or tunneling), you might not need the highest security settings. You can opt for faster but still secure encryption algorithms. Here are some suggestions:

- **Switch to a faster cipher**:
  
  Use `-c` to specify a cipher. AES with CTR mode is faster than CBC mode because it is more stream-oriented.

  ```bash
  ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -c aes128-ctr -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 user@server
  ```

  Other fast ciphers you might consider:
  - `chacha20-poly1305` (for low-power devices)
  - `aes128-gcm@openssh.com` (faster than the default AES-256)

  You can also check available ciphers by running:

  ```bash
  ssh -Q cipher
  ```

### 2. **Optimize Compression Settings**
The `-C` flag enables compression, which can save bandwidth. However, it might also add CPU overhead, which can be counterproductive if CPU power is limited. Test whether using compression improves or worsens performance based on your network and CPU power.

- **Test with and without compression** to see which is faster:
  ```bash
  ssh -D 1080 -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -c aes128-ctr -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 user@server
  ```
  Or with compression:
  ```bash
  ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -c aes128-ctr -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 user@server
  ```

### 3. **Use HPN-SSH Patch for High Bandwidth Performance**
The **High Performance Networking (HPN) patch for OpenSSH** removes SSH's built-in transfer speed limit (which is especially noticeable on high-latency or high-bandwidth connections). If you control both ends of the connection, you could install HPN-SSH on the server to unlock higher speeds.

- Install HPN-SSH on both the client and the server.
- Add the `-o NoneSwitch=yes` option to enable HPN features.

### 4. **Tweak TCP Buffer Size**
SSH’s default TCP window size might limit throughput on high-latency networks (like long-distance connections). You can increase the TCP buffer size to maximize throughput.

- **Set custom `TCP` window sizes** for both send and receive buffers:

  ```bash
  ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -c aes128-ctr -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 -o TCPRcvBuf=4194304 -o TCPSndBuf=4194304 user@server
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  - `TCPRcvBuf`: Increases the receiving buffer size.
  - `TCPSndBuf`: Increases the sending buffer size.
  
  Larger buffers help better utilize available bandwidth, especially on high-latency networks.

### 5. **Lower `ServerAliveInterval` and Tune `ServerAliveCountMax`**
For connections with frequent drops or if you are tunneling over unreliable networks, setting a lower `ServerAliveInterval` (e.g., 15 seconds) can help detect and recover from issues faster. Lowering `ServerAliveCountMax` can help SSH reconnect more quickly if there’s a problem.

- Reduce `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax`:
  ```bash
  ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -c aes128-ctr -o ServerAliveInterval=15 -o ServerAliveCountMax=2 user@server
  ```

### 6. **Parallelize Connections for Large Data Transfers**
If you are transferring large volumes of data, you can use parallel connections to speed up data transfer:

- Use the `-o ControlMaster=auto` and `-o ControlPersist=yes` options to keep the control socket alive and allow parallel SSH connections to share the same tunnel.

  ```bash
  ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=yes -c aes128-ctr -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 user@server
  ```

  This allows you to open multiple SSH sessions or tunnels over the same connection, reducing connection setup overhead.

### 7. **Reduce DNS Lookups**
To reduce latency on connections where DNS queries are slow, you can tell SSH to avoid DNS lookups:

- Disable DNS lookups using `-o UseDNS=no`:

  ```bash
  ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -c aes128-ctr -o UseDNS=no -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 user@server
  ```

### 8. **Improve Server-Side Settings**
If you have control over the SSH server, you can tweak its settings for better performance:
- **Enable TCP Fast Open (TFO)**: TFO reduces the number of round trips needed for TCP handshakes.
- **Adjust SSH daemon TCP window sizes**: Just like on the client side, increasing buffer sizes on the server helps.
- **Disable unnecessary logging** to minimize server-side CPU usage.

### 9. **Use a Faster Network Interface**
- If the remote server and your machine are connected via high-speed network links (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet), ensure that the server uses high-performance network interfaces.
- **Test different locations** of the remote SSH server. Sometimes, choosing a server with a lower latency (closer geographically) improves proxy speed.

### Sample Final Optimized Command
```bash
ssh -D 1080 -C -N -f -M -S /tmp/ssh_proxy_socket -c aes128-ctr -o ServerAliveInterval=15 -o ServerAliveCountMax=2 -o TCPRcvBuf=4194304 -o TCPSndBuf=4194304 -o UseDNS=no user@server
```

### Additional Tools and Approaches:
- **`autossh`**: If you find the connection drops frequently, you can use `autossh` to automatically restart the SSH session when it fails.
- **VPN Over SSH**: Depending on your needs, a full VPN over SSH (using `sshuttle` or `OpenVPN`) could improve routing efficiency, especially for long-lived connections.

These techniques should give you a speed boost in terms of both connection latency and throughput. Depending on your environment, you might need to experiment with different options for optimal performance.
